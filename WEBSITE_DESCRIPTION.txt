4. INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS & ANIMATIONS
================================================================================

ANIMATION STRATEGY:
All animations enhance user experience without creating distraction. They use 
GPU-accelerated properties (transform and opacity) for smooth performance.

Page Load Animations:
- Fade-In-Up: Content elements smoothly appear from bottom as page loads
- Duration: 0.6-0.8 seconds
- Easing: Cubic-bezier curve for natural, organic motion
- Staggering: 0.1-0.3 second delays between elements create flow

Continuous Animations:
- Logo Gradient Shift: 3-second infinite cycle, smooth color transitions
- Pagination Glow Pulse: Active carousel dots gently pulse with neon glow
- Creates sense of life and energy without distraction

Hover Interactions:
- Buttons: Rise 5px, scale 1.05, glow effect with dual shadow (cyan + pink)
- Cards: Lift 8-12px, scale 1.02-1.03, enhanced shadow
- Tool Tags: Shimmer effect with left-to-right animation
- Navigation Links: Underline appears smoothly from left
- Cursor: Changes to pointer on all interactive elements

Transition Timing:
- Standard: 0.4 seconds with cubic-bezier easing
- Form Inputs: 0.3 seconds for focus states
- Creates professional, responsive feel without feeling laggy

Performance Optimization:
- No animations during page load that cause layout shifts
- All animations use transform (position/scale) and opacity
- GPU acceleration enabled for smooth 60fps performance
- No jerking or stuttering reported
